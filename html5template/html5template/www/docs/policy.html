<h4>Last Updated: July 1st 2017</h4>

<p>LetzChat ("LetzChat," "we," and "us") respects the privacy of its users ("you") and has developed this Privacy Policy to demonstrate its commitment to protecting your privacy. This Privacy Policy describes the information we collect, how that information may be used, with whom it may be shared, and your choices about such uses and disclosures. We encourage you to read this Privacy Policy carefully when using our application or services or transacting business with us. By using our website or application (our "Service"), you are accepting the practices described in this Privacy Policy.</p>

<p>If you have any questions about our privacy practices, please refer to the end of this Privacy Policy for information on how to contact us.</p>

<h4>Information we collect about you</h4>

<p>In General. We may collect information that can identify you such as your name and email address ('personal information') and other information that does not identify you. We may collect this information through a website or a mobile application. By using the Service, you are authorizing us to gather, parse and retain data related to the provision of the Service. When you provide personal information through our Service, the information may be sent to servers located in the United States and countries around the world.</p>

<h4>Information you provide.</h4>

<p>In order to register as a user with LetzChat, you will be asked to sign in using your email and password. If you chat with other LetzChat users, you provide us the content of your chats, and if you contact us with a customer service or other inquiry, you provide us with the content of that communication.</p>

<h4>Information collected automatically.</h4>

<p>We automatically collect information from your browser or device when you visit our Service. This information could include your IP address, device ID and type, your browser type and language, the operating system used by your device, access times, your mobile device’s geographic location while our application is actively running, and the referring website address.</p>

<h4>Cookies and Use of Cookie Data.</h4>

<p>When you visit our Service, we may assign your device one or more cookies to facilitate access to our Service and to personalize your experience. Through the use of a cookie, we also may automatically collect information about your activity on our Service, such as the pages you visit, the time and date of your visits and the links you click. If we advertise, we (or third parties) may use certain data collected on our Service to show you LetzChat advertisements on other sites or applications.</p>

<h4>Mobile Device IDs.</h4>

<p>If you're using our app, we use mobile device IDs (the unique identifier assigned to a device by the manufacturer), or Advertising IDs (for iOS 6 and later), instead of cookies, to recognize you. We do this to store your preferences and track your use of our app. Unlike cookies, device IDs cannot be deleted, but Advertising IDs can be reset in "Settings" on your iPhone. Ad companies also use device IDs or Advertising IDs to track your use of the app, track the number of ads displayed, measure ad performance and display ads that are more relevant to you. Analytics companies use device IDs to track information about app usage.</p>

<h4>Information collected by third-parties for advertising purposes.</h4>

<p>We may allow service providers, advertising companies and ad networks, and other third parties to display advertisements on our Service. These companies may use tracking technologies, such as cookies or web beacons, to collect information about users who view or interact with their advertisements. We do not provide any non-anonymized personal information to third parties. Some of these third-party advertising companies may be advertising networks that are members of the Network Advertising Initiative, which offers a single location to opt out of ad targeting from member companies (www.networkadvertising.org). Opting out will not decrease the number of advertisements you see.</p>

<h4>How we use the information we collect</h4>

<p>In general, we may use information that we collect about you to:</p>

<ul>
    <li>deliver and improve our products and services, and manage our business;</li>
    
    <li>manage your account and provide you with customer support;</li>
    
    <li>perform research and analysis about your use of, or interest in, our or others’ products, services, or content;</li>
    
    <li>communicate with you by email, postal mail, telephone and/or mobile devices about products or services that may be of interest to you either from us or other third parties;</li>
    
    <li>develop, display, and track content and advertising tailored to your interests on our Service and other sites, including providing our advertisements to you when you visit other sites;</li>
    
    <li>website or mobile application analytics;</li>
    
    <li>verify your eligibility and deliver prizes in connection with contests and sweepstakes;</li>
    
    <li>enforce or exercise any rights in our Terms of Use; and</li>
    
    <li>perform functions or services as otherwise described to you at the time of collection.</li>
    
</ul>

<p>In all circumstances, we may perform these functions directly or use a third party vendor to perform these functions on our behalf who will be obligated to use your personal information only to perform services for us. </p>

<h4>With whom we share your information</h4>

<h4>Information Shared with Other Users.</h4>

<p>When you register as a user of LetzChat, your LetzChat profile will be viewable by other users of the Service. Other users will be able to view information you have provided to us directly, any additional photos you upload, your first name, your title, approximate location, your personal description, and social media links</p>

<h4>Personal information.</h4>

<p>We do not share your personal information with others except as indicated in this Privacy Policy or when we inform you and give you an opportunity to opt out of having your personal information shared. We may share personal information with:</p>

<h4>Service providers:</h4>

<p>We may share information, including personal and financial information, with third parties that perform certain services on our behalf. These services may include fulfilling orders, providing customer service and marketing assistance, performing business and sales analysis, ad tracking and analytics, member screenings, supporting our Service functionality, and supporting contests, sweepstakes, surveys and other features offered through our Service. These service providers may have access to personal information needed to perform their functions but are not permitted to share or use such information for any other purposes.</p>

<p>In Other Situations, we may disclose your information, including personal information:<p>


<ul>
    <li>In response to a subpoena or similar investigative demand, a court order, or a request for cooperation from a law enforcement or other government agency; to establish or exercise our legal rights; to defend against legal claims; or as otherwise required by law. In such cases, we may raise or waive any legal objection or right available to us.</li>
    
    <li>When we believe disclosure is appropriate in connection with efforts to investigate, prevent, or take other action regarding illegal activity, suspected fraud or other wrongdoing; to protect and defend the rights, property or safety of our company, our users, our employees, or others; to comply with applicable law or cooperate with law enforcement; or to enforce our Terms of Use or other agreements or policies.</li>
    
    <li>In connection with a substantial corporate transaction, such as the sale of our business, a divestiture, merger, consolidation, or asset sale, or in the unlikely event of bankruptcy.</li>
    
</ul>

<h4>Aggregated and/or non-personal information.</h4>

<p>We may use and share non-personal information we collect under any of the above circumstances. We may combine non-personal information we collect with additional non-personal information collected from other sources. We also may share aggregated, non-personal information, or personal information in hashed, non-human readable form, with third parties, including advisors, advertisers and investors, for the purpose of conducting general business analysis or other business purposes. For example, we may engage a data provider who may collect web log data from you (including IP address and information about your browser or operating system), or place or recognize a unique cookie on your browser to enable you to receive customized ads or content. The cookies may reﬂect de-identified demographic or other data linked to data you voluntarily have submitted to us (such as your email address), that we may share with a data provider solely in hashed, non-human readable form. To opt-out of cookies that may be set by third party data or advertising partners, please go to http://www.aboutads.info/choices/.</p>

<h4>Third Party Websites</h4>

<p>There are a number of places on our Service where you may click on a link to access other websites that do not operate under this Privacy Policy. For example, if you click on an advertisement on our Service, you may be taken to a website that we do not control. These third- party websites may independently solicit and collect information, including personal information, from you and, in some instances, provide us with information about your activities on those websites. We recommend that you consult the privacy statements of all third-party websites you visit by clicking on the "privacy" link typically located at the bottom of the webpage you are visiting.</p>

<h4>How you can access your information</h4>

<p>If you have a LetzChat account, you have the ability to review and update your personal information within the Service by opening your account and going to settings. More information about how to contact us is provided below. You also may close your account at any time by visiting the "Settings" page for your account. If you close your account, we will retain certain information associated with your account for analytical purposes and recordkeeping integrity, as well as to prevent fraud, enforce our Terms of Use, take actions we deem necessary to protect the integrity of our Service or our users, or take other actions otherwise permitted by law. In addition, if certain information has already been provided to third parties as described in this Privacy Policy, retention of that information will be subject to those third parties' policies.</p>

<h4>Your choices about collection and use of your information</h4>

<p>You can choose not to provide us with certain information, but that may result in you being unable to use certain features of our Service because such information may be required in order for you to register as user; purchase products or services; participate in a contest, promotion, survey, or sweepstakes; ask a question; or initiate other transactions.</p>

<p>Our Service may also deliver notifications to your phone or mobile device. You can disable these notifications by going into "App Settings" on the app or by changing the settings on your mobile device.</p>

<p>You can also control information collected by cookies. You can delete or decline cookies by changing your browser settings. Click "help" in the toolbar of most browsers for instructions.</p>

<h4>How we protect your personal information</h4>

<p>We take security measures to help safeguard your personal information from unauthorized access and disclosure. However, no system can be completely secure. Therefore, although we take steps to secure your information, we do not promise, and you should not expect, that your personal information, chats, or other communications will always remain secure. Users should also take care with how they handle and disclose their personal information and should avoid sending personal information through insecure email. Please refer to the Federal Trade Commission's website at http://www.ftc.gov/bcp/menus/consumer/data.shtm for information about how to protect yourself against identity theft.</p>

<h4>Information you provide about yourself while using our Service</h4>

<p>We provide areas on our Service where you can post information about yourself and others and communicate with others. Such postings are governed by our Terms of Use. Also, whenever you voluntarily disclose personal information on publicly-viewable pages, that information will be publicly available and can be collected and used by others. For example, if you post your email address, you may receive unsolicited messages. We cannot control who reads your posting or what other users may do with the information you voluntarily post, so we encourage you to exercise discretion and caution with respect to your personal information.</p>

<h4>Children's privacy</h4>

<p>Although our Service is a general audience Service, we restrict the use of our service to individuals age 17 and above. We do not knowingly collect, maintain, or use personal information from children under the age of 13.</p>

<h4>Visiting our Service from outside the United States</h4>

<p>If you are visiting our Service from outside the United States, please be aware that your information may be transferred to, stored, and processed in the United States where our servers are located and our central database is operated. By using our services, you understand and agree
that your information may be transferred to our facilities and those third parties with whom we share it as described in this privacy policy.</p>

<h4>No Rights of Third Parties</h4>

<p>This Privacy Policy does not create rights enforceable by third parties or require disclosure of any personal information relating to users of the website.</p>

<h4>Changes to this Privacy Policy</h4>

<p>We will occasionally update this Privacy Policy. When we post changes to this Privacy Policy, we will revise the 'last updated' date at the top of this Privacy Policy. We recommend that you check our Service from time to time to inform yourself of any changes in this Privacy Policy or any of our other policies.</p>
